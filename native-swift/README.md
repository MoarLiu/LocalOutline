# Bike Native

原生 Swift/macOS 版本放在本目录内，和仓库根目录的 Electron/Web 版本并行存在。这里的代码、脚本、测试和打包产物都不覆盖现有 `src/`、`electron/`、`server/`、`package.json`。

## Current Shape

- Minimum target: macOS 15+
- Bundle id: `com.bike.native`
- Runtime: SwiftUI + AppKit bridges, with Markdown files plus a sidecar metadata file as the primary storage
- Compatibility format: current `Workspace version: 1` JSON
- Markdown storage path: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Bike/`
- JSON backup path: `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Bike/.backups/`
- Web Sync: manual document-level sync through a deployed Bike Sync Server

## 1.4.x parity

- Product name, bundle metadata, iCloud paths, and release script defaults are aligned with Bike 1.4.x.
- The app menu, toolbar, and settings expose API key configuration and update checking.
- The sidebar, settings, and Bike menu expose Web Sync configuration and manual sync actions.
- Outline, mind map, and Markdown modes expose AI generate/polish actions.
- AI provider compatibility matches the Electron/Web implementation: Responses input uses a list, Chat/completions is supported, HTML endpoint mismatches show a clear error, Responses SSE text streams are parsed, and generated children accept flexible JSON keys such as `children`, `nodes`, `items`, `topics`, `title`, `name`, and `label`.
- The main window defaults to `1366 × 960` with a minimum size of `980 × 640`.

This workspace currently uses SwiftPM. `scripts/build_and_run.sh` builds a native `.app` bundle under `native-swift/dist/`. The release script writes a local DMG under `native-swift/release/`; build outputs are ignored by `native-swift/.gitignore`.

## Persistence / Backup

- `Sources/BikeNative/Persistence/WorkspaceRepository.swift` owns workspace load/save, debounced-save persistence targets, iCloud Drive Markdown storage, sidecar metadata, legacy JSON migration, snapshot creation/listing, and snapshot restore.
- `Sources/BikeNative/Services/AppStore.swift` debounces autosave with a cancellable `Task.sleep`.
- `Sources/BikeNative/Services/BackupService.swift` contains `ICloudBackupService` and `FilePanelService`.
- `Sources/BikeNative/Services/SyncService.swift` contains the Bike Web Sync API client, plain UserDefaults sync settings, revision state, and document-level merge/conflict logic.
- `Sources/BikeNative/Core/SelfTestRunner.swift` covers JSON compatibility, repository save/load, snapshots, restore, and iCloud backup file behavior.

## Web Sync

1.4.3 fixes interrupted-sync retry checkpoints and commits downloaded revisions only after the workspace is saved. It preserves mobile shortcut flags and extension fields through sync and Markdown sidecar storage. Content changes clear stale Markdown; view-only changes keep the original source. The native client continues to guard editing during sync and checks for workspace changes before applying network results.

After deploying Bike Sync Server, open Web Sync from the sidebar gear, Settings, or the Bike menu. Enter the deployed sync service URL and the device sync key configured in `config/bike-sync.config.json`.

- `保存并同步` runs document-level bidirectional sync.
- `上传` initializes or replaces remote documents from this Mac, guarded by expected revisions.
- `拉取` replaces the local workspace from Web after creating a local snapshot.
- `后台自动同步` runs after local saves and on the configured interval; quiet no-op syncs do not show notices.

The device key, server URL, and revision checkpoints are stored plainly in UserDefaults. Bike Native does not read the macOS Keychain for Web Sync.

## Commands

```bash
./scripts/build_and_run.sh
./scripts/test_all.sh
./scripts/package_dmg.sh
```

Useful variants:

```bash
./scripts/build_and_run.sh --verify
./scripts/build_and_run.sh --logs
VERSION=1.4.3 ./scripts/package_dmg.sh
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./scripts/package_dmg.sh
```

`package_dmg.sh` creates an unsigned/ad-hoc local DMG by default. Developer ID signing, notarization, and stapling require a full Xcode install and Apple Developer credentials.
